# letterboxd-scraper

A few web scraping tools for Letterboxd public data that hopefully will become
something fun someday... 🐛

Currently, there are scripts for:
- Getting basic information from a film's page
- Saving a user's watchlist to a CSV file
- Comparing two user's watchlists and saving the result to a CSV file
